        About Us
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
    
<p>Black Art-Chives was founded in 2018 and is located in Atlanta, Georgia. Founders Lyric McGhee, Venise Ivey and Kendarious Eason focused their efforts in bringing awareness and unity to African Americans through art. They believed if people could see the love and beauty around them, it would make them see it in themselves and spread it to everyone one person at a time. They each had a hand in helping build the art gallery from ground up combining their visions into one. In starting Black Art-Chives, they partnered with nonprofits that focused on helping youth in poverty stricken African American communities. Raising Expectations and Black Youth Project are two proud partners of Black Art-Chives.
Black Art-Chives look forward to building in different locations in the near future to give more access to African American art work and be platforms for African American artists in different areas.
